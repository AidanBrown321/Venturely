This is my personal project of a travel web app. The Travel Web App is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that allows users to create personalized accounts, curate bucket lists, and log their past travel experiences. The app features real-time database interactions, ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience. This is still a work in progress and will continue to be for a bit longer, there are a lot of features that I am working on
adding! It is not fully deployed but I will provide a demonstration of how it works.

To run locally, you would need access to the MongoDb database connection string or connect to your own and run npm i, and then npm run dev.
